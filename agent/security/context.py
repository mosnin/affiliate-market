"""AgentContext — runtime-injected security boundary.

spaceId is NEVER taken from LLM tool arguments. It is injected once when the
agent run starts and flows through every tool call via RunContextWrapper.
This prevents prompt-injection attacks from crossing tenant boundaries.

Autonomy is fixed: every contact-facing action drafts. There is no per-space
or per-agent override. Configuration is failure to decide.
