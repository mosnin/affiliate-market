"""Tool-runtime permission guard for manager tools (defense layer 3).

Three layers gate every manager-side action; this file is the last one:

  1. ROUTE GUARD     — `app/manager/cola/page.tsx` server component
                       redirects when the caller isn't a manager.
  2. API GATE        — `app/api/ai/manager-task/route.ts` re-runs
                       `resolveManagerContext()` before posting to Modal.
  3. TOOL-RUNTIME    — this guard. Every manager tool MUST call it before
                       doing any work; a tool that skips it would execute
                       even if a misconfigured caller slipped past layers
                       1 and 2.

The contract is enforced at THIS layer because the agent runs inside a Modal
sandbox far away from the Next.js auth surface. Modal has only the context
the Next.js route hands it; if a future bug lets a non-manager context reach
here, the manager tools must still refuse.

Phase 2/3 tools wrap their handler body like this:

    @function_tool(strict_mode=False)
    async def some_manager_tool(ctx: RunContextWrapper[AgentContext], ...):
        require_manager_role(ctx)        # ← MUST come before any DB call
        # ... rest of the handler ...

`require_manager_role` raises `ManagerPermissionError` on refusal. The Agents
SDK serialises tool exceptions into model-visible tool outputs, so the model
sees a clear refusal and won't loop on the same tool — and the seller /
manager never sees raw DB state from a tool that shouldn't have run.
