"""Agent activity audit log.

Two surfaces:

  log_activity_run (function_tool, agent-facing) — the agent calls this once
    at the end of a substantive run with a summary of what was decided. The
    realtor sees these in the activity feed; brokers see them rolled up.

  persist_log (internal helper) — every lifecycle tool (book_tour,
    advance_deal_stage, route_lead, send_property_packet, request_deal_review,
    draft_message) calls this after a successful write so the broker rollup
    has per-action signal instead of one summary per run.

Both write to AgentActivityLog. Same shape, different callers.
