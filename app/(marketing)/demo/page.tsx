/**
 * `/demo` — book a demo.
 *
 * One focal element: the scheduler. A company or team evaluating Cola
 * lands here, reads one sentence about what they'll see, and books a time.
 * No second ask competing — just a quiet "start now" line under the calendar.
 *
 * Auth users bounce to their workspace (same pattern as the homepage); a
 * signed-in seller doesn't need to book a sales walkthrough.
 *
 * Swapping in the real scheduler is ONE line: paste the Calendly inline-embed
 * URL into CALENDLY_URL below. Empty → a calm placeholder renders instead.
