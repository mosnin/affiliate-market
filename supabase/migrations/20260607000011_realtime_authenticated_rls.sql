-- Restore Realtime as a functional product surface.
--
-- The previous migration (20260409_fix_realtime_rls.sql) replaced the
-- old USING(true) anon policies with USING(false), correctly closing a
-- cross-tenant leak — but it also killed every Realtime subscription
-- because the browser client connects with the anon key. Every "live"
-- toast in components/dashboard/live-notifications.tsx and every
-- subscription in notification-center.tsx silently fired zero events,
-- masked by the 5-minute polling fallback.
--
-- This migration restores live updates the right way: switch the
-- subscribing role to `authenticated` and scope each policy to the
-- caller's spaces via auth.jwt() ->> 'sub' → User.clerkId → Space.ownerId.
-- The Clerk JWT bridge (lib/supabase-browser.ts + hooks/use-supabase-
-- realtime-auth.ts) feeds the JWT into Realtime; this migration owns
-- the database side of the contract.
--
-- Tenant scoping rule (single predicate, four tables): a Contact / Deal /
-- DealStage / Demo row is readable if its spaceId belongs to a Space
-- whose owner's clerkId matches the JWT's `sub` claim. Company members
-- with shared access via CompanyMembership are out of scope for this
-- pass — they currently see zero events (same as today), and we'll add
-- their predicate in a follow-up once we observe the seller path
-- working in production.
