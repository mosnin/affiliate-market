-- Company offboarding hardening (follow-up to 20260506000000)
-- ============================================================================
-- Audit of BP1 found two SECURITY items:
--
--   1. GRANT EXECUTE ... TO authenticated meant any Clerk-authed user talking
--      to Supabase via the anon key + a JWT could invoke the RPC directly,
--      bypassing the API-level role check. Only server-side code (which
--      uses SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) ever needs to call this function;
--      the API route is the single entry point. Revoking the authenticated
--      grant closes the bypass.
--
--   2. The function trusted its callers to have pre-verified that the
--      destination user is still 'active'. Defense-in-depth: check inside
--      the function too, so a direct service_role call (e.g. a future
--      background job) can't accidentally transfer data to an offboarded
--      user.
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Tighten grant.
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION offboard_company_member(text, text, text, boolean)
  FROM authenticated;

-- 2. Replace the function body with one that also guards the destination's
-- status. CREATE OR REPLACE preserves the existing signature/grants on
-- service_role; we just swap the definition. Everything else about the
-- function (locking, transfer scope, return shape) is unchanged — copy the
-- body verbatim from the original migration and add the destination check
-- near the top alongside the existing Space lookups.
