-- AgentTrajectory: per-run materialized record joining tool calls, costs,
-- model, status, triggers, and outcomes into one queryable artifact.
--
-- Background: the orchestrator already records pieces of every run
-- (AgentActivityLog rows, tool-call logger entries, cost-tracker rows,
-- AgentDraft outcomes, the SSE event stream in Redis). The pieces don't
-- meet anywhere — answering "show me every run where schedule_tour was
-- called after tour_completed and the draft was approved" requires a
-- multi-table join across systems with different lifetimes.
--
-- This table materializes the trajectory at end-of-run. Read by SQL today
-- for offline eval; becomes RL training data in 12 months when the
-- (trajectory, outcome) pair count is large enough to matter.
--
-- Idempotent: IF NOT EXISTS throughout. Safe to re-run.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "AgentTrajectory" (
  "id" UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  -- The run identifier the orchestrator generates at run start. Matches
  -- the runId used in the per-run SSE stream (agent:stream:{spaceId}:{runId}
  -- in Redis) so trajectories can be joined to the live event log if needed.
  "runId" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,

  -- Tenant scoping. Same FK pattern as every other agent table. Space.id is
  -- `text` (DB_CONVENTIONS: all PKs are text), so this MUST be text — a `uuid`
  -- column made the FK impossible to build, which aborted the whole CREATE and
  -- left AgentTrajectory non-existent in every environment, prod included.
