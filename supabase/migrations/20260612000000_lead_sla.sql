-- Speed-to-lead SLA enforcement.
--
-- Makes lead routing agentic: once a lead is routed to a seller, Cola holds
-- the seller (and the manager) to a first-response clock. These three columns
-- are the per-company policy the enforcement sweep reads
-- (`lib/manager-sla.ts`, run by `/api/cron/lead-sla`):
--
--   * "slaEnabled"               — off by default; the manager turns it on.
--   * "slaFirstResponseMinutes"  — how long a routed lead may sit un-worked
--                                   before Cola nudges the assigned seller.
--   * "slaEscalateMinutes"       — how long before Cola escalates the
--                                   still-untouched lead to the manager.
--
-- Additive + idempotent: no existing column touched. Detection needs no new
-- schema — a routed lead is the `assigned-by-manager`-tagged Contact clone in
-- the seller's space; "un-worked" = lastContactedAt IS NULL; the clock starts
-- at the clone's createdAt (assignment time).
