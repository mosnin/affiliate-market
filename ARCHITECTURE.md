# ARCHITECTURE.md

System map for Chippi.

> ⚠️ **This prose has drifted from the code in places — do not trust it over the source.** For mechanical structure (every route, table, cron, tool) the **canonical, CI-gated** reference is `docs/repo-map.generated.md`; for the symptom→system→files judgment layer, see `SYSTEMS.md`. Known stale spots below have been corrected inline, but the directory map / route names in §2–§3 still describe an older shape (e.g. it mentions `/dashboard` and `/onboarding` routes that **no longer exist** — real post-login routing is `app/auth/redirect`, onboarding UI is `app/setup`). When in doubt, read the code or the generated map.

## 0. Non-negotiable runtime invariants

1. **Slug-only identity**: Workspace identity is slug-only in runtime (`/s/:slug`, `/apply/:slug`). Never derive workspace identity from host/hostname/header parsing.
2. **Canonical onboarding completion**: Onboarding completion is determined only by `User.onboard`, via `lib/onboarding.ts` helpers.
3. **Canonical intake submission pipeline**: Public intake submissions must go through `app/api/public/apply/route.ts` with `publicApplicationSchema` validation and idempotency safeguards.
4. **DB naming safety**: Runtime field is `Space.slug` maps directly to the `slug` column in Supabase; do not perform destructive column renames without an explicit expand/contract plan.

## 4. Data flow overview

```
1. User signs in via Clerk
2. /dashboard checks onboarding state
   → If no space: redirect to /onboarding
   → If space exists: redirect to /s/[slug]
3. Onboarding wizard (7 steps):
   → Creates User record (upsert from Clerk)
   → Creates Space + SpaceSetting + default DealStages
   → Sets onboardingCompletedAt on User
4. Intake link: /apply/[slug]
   → Public form → POST /api/public/apply
   → Creates Contact with tags ['application-link', 'new-lead']
   → Calls scoreLeadApplication (OpenAI)
   → Updates Contact with score fields
   → On failure: persists fallback unscored state
5. CRM workspace views:
   → Leads page: reads contacts with 'application-link' tag
   → Contacts page: full CRUD with type filter
   → Deals page: kanban with stages and drag/reorder
6. AI assistant:
   → Streams response via OpenAI
   → Enriches with vector context from Supabase pgvector (scoped to caller's spaceId)
   → Persists messages to Message table
```

---

## 5. Auth flow

- **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`): Clerk middleware protects `/dashboard`, `/s/*`, `/onboarding`. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in` with `redirect_url`.
- **Public routes**: `/`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/admin`, `/apply/*`, `/legal/*` are accessible without auth.
- **Onboarding guard**: `/dashboard` page and `/s/[slug]/layout.tsx` both check `onboardingCompletedAt` or space existence. Legacy accounts with space but no completion timestamp are auto-healed.
- **API auth**: Protected API routes call `auth()` from Clerk and return 401 if no `userId`.
- **Public API**: `/api/public/apply` does **not** require auth (prospect-facing).

---

## 6. Onboarding flow

7-step wizard persisted via `User.onboardingCurrentStep`:

| Step | Name | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Welcome | Intro screen, no data saved |
| 2 | Profile basics | Saves name, phone, business name to User + SpaceSetting |
| 3 | Public intake link | Creates Space with slug, SpaceSetting, default DealStages (New, Reviewing, Showing, Applied, Approved, Declined) |
| 4 | Application flow | Informational — shows what the intake form collects |
| 5 | Notifications | Saves email notification preference and default submission status |
| 6 | CRM preview | Informational — shows mock lead card |
| 7 | Go live | Shows intake link, copy button, test submit. Marks `onboardingCompletedAt`. |

Completion sets `onboardingCurrentStep = 7` and `onboardingCompletedAt = now()`.

---

## 7. Application submission flow

1. Public page at `/apply/[slug]` resolves Space by slug.
2. Form collects: name (required), phone (required), email, budget, timeline, preferred areas, notes.
3. POST to `/api/public/apply` with JSON payload.
4. API validates required fields (`slug`, `name`, `phone`).
5. Deduplication: checks for same name + normalized phone + `application-link` tag within last 2 minutes.
6. Creates Contact with `type: QUALIFICATION`, `tags: ['application-link', 'new-lead']`, `scoringStatus: 'pending'`.
7. Calls `scoreLeadApplication` → updates Contact with score fields.
8. Returns 201 with contact ID and scoring result.
9. On scoring failure: Contact still persisted with `scoringStatus: 'failed'`, `scoreLabel: 'unscored'`.

---

## 8. Scoring flow

- **Function**: `scoreLeadApplication` in `lib/lead-scoring.ts`
- **Model**: the lead *score* is deterministic (rules engine, `lib/scoring/`); the AI *summary* enhancement uses `gpt-4.1-mini` (`lib/scoring/enhance.ts`). The chat agent defaults to `x-ai/grok-4.3` (realtor-selected via OpenRouter), NOT `gpt-5-mini`.
- **Format**: Structured JSON output via `response_format.json_schema`
- **Input**: name, email, phone, budget, timeline, preferredAreas, notes
- **Output contract** (`LeadScoringResult`):
  - `scoringStatus`: `scored` | `failed` | `pending`
  - `leadScore`: 0-100 or null
  - `scoreLabel`: `hot` (75-100) | `warm` (45-74) | `cold` (0-44) | `unscored`
  - `scoreSummary`: explainable text, max 300 chars
- **Validation**: Zod schema validates parsed JSON
- **Fallback**: On any failure (missing key, empty response, invalid JSON, schema failure, provider error), returns `{ scoringStatus: 'failed', leadScore: null, scoreLabel: 'unscored', scoreSummary: 'Scoring unavailable right now. Lead saved successfully.' }`

---

## 9. CRM flow

- **Leads page** (`app/s/[slug]/leads/page.tsx`): Filters contacts by `application-link` tag. Clears `new-lead` tag on page load. Shows score, budget, timeline, areas, notes, scoring summary.
- **Contacts page** (`app/s/[slug]/contacts/page.tsx`): Full CRUD. Lifecycle types: `QUALIFICATION`, `TOUR`, `APPLICATION`. Search by name/email/phone/preferences.
- **Deals page** (`app/s/[slug]/deals/page.tsx`): Kanban board with DealStages. Drag-and-drop via @dnd-kit. Position-based ordering.
- **Contact detail** (`app/s/[slug]/contacts/[id]/page.tsx`): Individual contact view.
- **AI assistant** (`app/s/[slug]/ai/page.tsx`): Chat interface with streaming responses and message history.

---

## 10. Billing flow

- **Billing IS implemented** (brokerage seat-based). `stripe@^20` is a dependency; `lib/stripe.ts` is the client; routes live at `app/api/billing/{checkout,portal,cancel}` plus the `app/api/webhooks/stripe` receiver. Plans/seats: `lib/brokerage-seats.ts`, price IDs via `STRIPE_PRICE_{STARTER,TEAM,ENTERPRISE}`.
- `SpaceSetting.billingSettings` is a legacy string column, separate from the brokerage Stripe flow.
- NOTE: this section previously claimed "No Stripe package, billing not implemented" — that was **wrong**; billing exists and is live.

---

## 11. Deployment notes

- **Build command**: `next build`
- **`next.config.ts`**: ignores TypeScript and ESLint build errors (`ignoreBuildErrors: true`, `ignoreDuringBuilds: true`)
- **Vercel packages**: `@vercel/analytics`, `@vercel/speed-insights` present
- **Domain handling**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` env var, falls back to `workflowrouting.com` (prod) or `localhost:3000` (dev). Protocol derived from `NODE_ENV`.

---

## 12. Known risks, coupling points, unclear areas

1. **Legacy Redis path**: `app/actions.ts` and `lib/slugs.ts` use Upstash Redis for slug metadata. The admin dashboard also relies on Redis. Potential for state divergence with Supabase as source of truth.
2. **Build error suppression**: TypeScript and ESLint errors are ignored during build. Type and lint issues can accumulate silently.
3. **(Stale — resolved)** Billing **is** implemented via Stripe (brokerage seats); see §10. This item previously read "billing not implemented."
4. **Tenant isolation**: API routes check auth and all vector queries are scoped by `spaceId`, but workspace ownership verification in other routes varies. Sensitive area for security review.
5. **Post-login routing** lives in `app/auth/redirect/page.tsx` (NOT `/dashboard` — that route does not exist) and `app/s/[slug]/layout.tsx`. Onboarding completion is gated by `User.onboard` via `lib/onboarding.ts`.
6. **Two space creation paths**: `app/api/onboarding/route.ts` (create_space action) and `app/actions.ts` (createSlugAction) both create spaces with different default stage names.
7. **Vector dependency optional**: pgvector/embeddings failures are silently caught — assistant works without RAG. But scoring requires OpenAI.
8. **pgvector setup**: The `vector` extension and `DocumentEmbedding` table must be created in Supabase before vector sync works. Run the additions in `supabase/schema.sql` via the Supabase SQL Editor.

---

## 13. Multi-Account Role & Organization System

Added in migration `20260314000003_org_system.sql`.

### Roles

| Level | How determined | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Realtor** | Default for all users | Own workspace only |
| **Broker** | Has `BrokerageMembership` with `role IN (broker_owner, broker_admin)` | `/broker` dashboard + member oversight |
| **Platform Admin** | `User.platformRole = 'admin'` OR Clerk `publicMetadata.role = 'admin'` | `/admin` + all management |

Grant platform admin via DB: `UPDATE "User" SET "platformRole" = 'admin' WHERE "clerkId" = '...';`

### Organization Model

```
User (1) → Space (1, realtor workspace, optional Brokerage FK)
         → BrokerageMembership (0..n)

Brokerage (1) → BrokerageMembership (n) → User
             → Invitation (n)
```

Key constraints:
- One `Space` per `User` — `UNIQUE(Space.ownerId)`
- One `Brokerage` per owner — `UNIQUE INDEX ON Brokerage(ownerId)`
- One membership per user per brokerage — `UNIQUE(brokerageId, userId)`
- Realtor workspace stays fully independent even when linked to a brokerage

### Permission Helpers (`lib/permissions.ts` + `lib/api-auth.ts`)

Four helpers gate every API route and server component. They all share an **offboarding hard-stop**: if the caller's `User.status === 'offboarded'`, the helper rejects (or returns `null`) even when Clerk auth is otherwise valid — a broker-initiated offboarding has to lock the user out of the API immediately, before their Clerk session naturally expires. The check is wrapped in a try/catch so a missing `status` column (pre-BP1a migration) falls through as active.

| Helper | Module | Returns | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requireAuth()` | `lib/api-auth.ts` | `{ userId }` or a `401`/`403` `NextResponse` | Default on every protected API route — gates on Clerk session + `User.status != 'offboarded'` |
| `requireBroker()` | `lib/permissions.ts` | `{ brokerage, membership, dbUserId }` — throws `Forbidden: broker access required` otherwise | Routes restricted to `broker_owner` or `broker_admin` (loads `BrokerageMembership` after the shared auth + offboarding check) |
| `getBrokerContext()` | `lib/permissions.ts` | Same shape as `requireBroker` **or `null`** | Server components / pages that want to redirect instead of 500 on non-brokers (e.g. `app/broker/activity/page.tsx`) |
| `getBrokerMemberContext()` | `lib/permissions.ts` | Same shape as `getBrokerContext`, including `realtor_member` | Broker-scoped pages that need to be reachable by any brokerage member, not just admins/owners |

Supporting helpers: `isPlatformAdmin()` + `requirePlatformAdmin()` for `/admin` routes, `getCurrentDbUser()` for resolving Clerk `userId` → internal `User` row, and role predicates `canManageLeads` / `canEditSettings` / `canManageRoles` / `canChangeRole`.

**Dual-auth pattern** — `POST /api/broker/reviews/[id]/comments` (`app/api/broker/reviews/[id]/comments/route.ts`) accepts **either** a broker member of the review's brokerage **or** the requesting agent who opened the review. This is the canonical template for "a broker OR the involved agent can do X" endpoints: call `requireAuth()` first, load the resource, then allow access if the caller is in the brokerage (via `getBrokerMemberContext` / direct membership lookup) OR if `resource.requestingUserId === dbUser.id`.

### Invitation Lifecycle

```
pending → accepted   (user clicks accept, creates BrokerageMembership)
pending → expired    (expiresAt < now, auto-marked on accept attempt)
pending → cancelled  (future: admin cancels)
```

Invitation token is a 64-char hex string generated by DB (`encode(gen_random_bytes(32), 'hex')`).

### Broker Dashboard (`/broker`)

- Overview: member count, pending invites, leads needing follow-up, applications received
- Members: roster with activation status and workspace slug
- Invitations: sent list + inline send form

### Self-serve Brokerage Creation

Realtors create a brokerage from **Configure → Brokerage** in their workspace. This calls `POST /api/broker/create`, creates a `Brokerage` + `BrokerageMembership (broker_owner)`, and redirects to `/broker`.
