# 03 User Flows

## Flow: Visitor To Signup

1. Visitor lands on `/` (home page / sign-in page)
2. Sees "Welcome to Cola" with Clerk sign-in component
3. Creates account via email/password or OAuth through Clerk
4. Clerk creates user → webhook or first-visit creates User row in Supabase
5. User is now authenticated and redirected back to `/`

Branch: If visitor is a manager, clicks "Company login" link → `/login/manager` for manager-specific sign-in.
Branch: If user is already signed in, visiting `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` redirects to `/`.

## Flow: Signup To Onboarding

1. Authenticated user arrives at `/` → OnboardingFlow component renders inline
2. System checks if user has a workspace (Space record)
3. If no workspace → multi-step onboarding flow:
   - Step 1: Account type selection (seller / manager)
   - Step 2: Workspace name + emoji selection
   - Step 3: Profile basics
   - Step 4+: Additional setup steps (intake link config, etc.)
4. Progress tracked via User.onboardingCurrentStep
5. On completion → Space created, User.onboard set to true
6. Redirect to `/s/[slug]` (workspace dashboard)

Branch: If manager-only account type selected → redirect to `/manager` after company creation.
Branch: If user already has a space → redirect directly to `/s/[slug]` via `/dashboard`.

5. Application creates Contact with tags=['application-link', 'new-lead']
