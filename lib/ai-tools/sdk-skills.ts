/**
 * Specialist sub-agent factories. Delegates to the SKILL.md loader.
 *
 * Before commit 8d51b97: each specialist's `name`, `instructions`, and
 * tool list lived as hand-coded TS strings here. New skills meant a new
 * exported function and inline copy that wasn't editable by non-engineers.
 *
 * After: each specialist is a `lib/ai-tools/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` with
 * Anthropic Agent Skills-style frontmatter. The exported functions below
 * are the unchanged public surface that `sdk-chat.ts` (and tests) call.
 * Internally they ask the loader to build the Agent from the SKILL.md.
 *
 * Why preserve these wrappers instead of having `sdk-chat.ts` call
 * `buildSkillAgent('pipeline-analyst', ...)` directly: backwards-compat
 * keeps the diff small. If a future commit ever inlines them, the loader
 * is the source of truth either way.
